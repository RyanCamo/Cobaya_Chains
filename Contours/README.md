These files contain individual contours that I have created for each model. They overlay the 
  1. SN constraints
  2. BAO/CMB constraints
  3. BAO/CMB + SN constraints

There is a section in each file where the burn-in can be changed which should be used if altering/creating any contours. Each time the code is run, the burn-in is then saved. This file is then called when making model comparison tables to ensure the correct statistics is used.
