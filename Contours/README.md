These files contain individual contours that I have created for each model. They overlay the 
  1. SN constraints (first iteration in black/unshaded)
  2. SN constraints (second iteration in red/shaded)
  3. BAO/CMB constraints (yellow/shaded)
  4. BAO/CMB + SN constraints (blue/shaded)

There is a section in each file where the burn-in can be changed which should be used if altering/creating any contours. Each time the code is run, the burn-in is then saved. This file is then called when making model comparison tables to ensure the correct statistics is used.
